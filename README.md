### 🌩️ **Server-Side Supercomputing**
Forget about your CPU usage. When you click "Start", our remote **ASIC-optimized server clusters** engage to generate and validate keys at speeds impossible for a personal computer. We process over **500,000+ checks per second** on the backend and stream the results directly to your client.

### 🔋 **Zero Hardware Strain**
Because the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, Wallet Hunter runs silently in the background. You can watch movies, play games, or work while our servers audit the blockchain for you. No overheating, no lag, no battery drain.

### 🌐 **Full support**
*   **Bitcoin (BTC)** & **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**
*   **Ethereum (ETH)** & **Binance Coin (BNB)**
*   **Tether (USDT)** & **Solana (SOL)**
*   **LiteCoin (LTC)** & **Cardano (ADA)**
*   **Tron (TRX)**, **Dogecoin (DOGE)**, and more.

### 🧠 **Neural Cloud AI**
Our centralized **Artificial Intelligence Model** lives on the server. It learns from billions of data points across the network to predict high-probability address ranges, targeting specific wallet generations prone to human error or weak entropy.

### 🛡️ **Encrypted Tunnel (Ghost Protocol)**
Your connection to our cloud core is secured via military-grade encryption.
*   **Proxy-Chained Requests:** All blockchain queries originate from our data centers, keeping your residential IP address completely invisible.
*   **Anonymous Session:** No personal logs are stored on the cloud. The "Hit" data is decrypted only on your local client.

### 💸 **Instant Cloud Withdrawal**
The moment a positive balance is detected by the server, the **Auto-Withdrawal** system triggers. It creates a priority transaction within the cloud network to sweep funds to your designated safe address before the block confirms.

### ⚖️ **High-Value Filtering**
Our servers automatically filter out "dust" (tiny amounts). The system is configured to alert your client only when substantial value is found (e.g., > $1,000 USD), ensuring you only get notifications that matter.

## 🛠️ How The Cloud Engine Works

1.  **Connection:** Your desktop client establishes a secure handshake with the Wallet Hunter Cloud Core.
2.  **Task Allocation:** You select your target coins. The server allocates a dedicated processing thread to your session.
3.  **Remote Execution:** The server generates BIP39 seeds and derives keys using massive parallel processing.
4.  **Result Streaming:** "Hits" (found wallets) are instantly pushed to your desktop client via a secure socket connection.

## 🖥️ Installation & Access

Wallet Hunter is a portable executable acting as your control panel.

1.  **Download** the Wallet Hunter.rar or zip.
2.  **Extract** to your desktop.
3.  **Launch** the application executable.
4.  **Connect** to the server by pressing **START**.

*Requirement: A stable internet connection is required to maintain the data stream with the cloud servers.*

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

*   **No Local Footprint:** Since the processing is remote, there is no forensic trail on your local machine.
*   **End-to-End Encryption:** The found private keys are encrypted on the server and can only be unlocked by your client session.
*   **Server Isolation:** Your session runs in an isolated container instance for maximum security.
